# Phylogenetic divergence dating and biogeographical reconstruction

Welcome to the *Cyanistes* computer practical of the Island Biology course. Here you will find the material to learn how produce a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree based on Genbank sequences and then use it to reconstruct ancestral areas and perform molecular species delimitation. We will apply these approaches to a case study of a group of birds from the Canary Islands, the afrocanarian blue-tits *Cyanistes*.
